• Designed a 4‑bit digital binary calculator in Quartus II to perform a diverse set of arithmetic and logical operations, with the goal of creating a
lab exercise for future students taking this course.
• Developed software to take two 4‑bit binary numbers as input and produce arithmetic or logic results on the Altera D2 Board.
• Utilized digital circuit strategies and VHDL code to design arithmetic and logical operations; the final circuit operated with 3 control bits to
choose from 8 operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, XOR, NAND, AND, and OR.
• Ensured accurate and reliable operation of the calculator by debugging and refining the VHDL code and circuit design.
• Successfully created a functional 4‑bit digital calculator, demonstrating strong skills in digital circuit design and VHDL programming, and pro‑
viding a valuable lab exercise for future students.
